Consider a d- dimensional signal with a change point at a moment \\nu : x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_{\\nu-1}, x_{\\nu}, x_{\\nu+1}, x_{\\nu+2}, \\cdots In the most general case, the observations are arbitrary dependent and nonidentically distributed. Change point is a moment of time, when distribution of time series observations changes. Thus, it can be described as changing of conditional pre-change densities p_0(x_i|x_1, \\cdots, x_{i-1}) for i \\le \\nu to conditional post-change densities p_1(x_i|x_1, \\cdots, x_{i-1}) for i > \\nu . In a typical setup this is an unsupervised task with unknown signal distributions. Figure 1 shows an example with several change points and results of their detection. Figure 1. Example of change points. Applications There is a range of various applications of change point detection [1]: quality control of production process, structural health monitoring of wind turbines, and aircraft, detecting multiple sensor faults, detecting road traffic incidents or changes in highway traffic condition, chemical process control, physiological data analysis, surveillance of daily disease counts, nanoscale analysis of soft biomaterials, biosurveillance, radio-astronomy and interferometry, spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems, leak detection in water channels, environmental monitoring, handling climate changes, navigation systems monitoring, human motion analysis, video scene analysis, sequential steganography, biometric identification, onset detection in music signals, detecting changes in large payment card datasets, distributed systems monitoring, detection of intrusion, viruses, and other denial of service (DoS) attacks, segmentation of signals and images, tracking the preferences of users in recommendation systems, seismic data processing, analysis of financial data and others.

It is based on binary classifiers in machine learning. A classifier takes two parts of the signal with window_size observations and separates them into two classes. Then, it uses predictions to estimate the probability density ratio for these observations and calculate the change point score between the windows. The method refits the classifier on each new pair of windows. from roerich.algorithms import ChangePointDetectionClassifier from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis # sklearn-like binary classifier clf = QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis() # change points detection cpd = ChangePointDetectionClassifier(base_classifier=clf, metric='KL_sym', periods=1, window_size=100, step=1, n_runs=1) score, cps_pred = cpd.predict(X) # visualization roerich.display(X, cps_true, score, cps_pred) Now, let\u2019s measure the quality of change point detection using Precision and Recall metrics. # metrics precision, recall = roerich.metrics.precision_recall_scores(cps_true, cps_pred, window=20) auc = roerich.metrics.pr_auc(cps_true, cps_pred, score[cps_pred], window=20) print('Precision: ', precision) print('Recall: ', recall) print('PR AUC: ', auc) Precision: 1.0 Recall: 1.0 PR AUC: 1.0 The ChangePointDetectionClassifier method can take any sklearn-like binary classifier. For example, you use your favorite Neural Network or Gradient Boosting over Decision Trees algorithm. The following example uses a shallow Neural Network implemented in PyTroch as a base classifier for change point detection. # pytorch NN classifier clf = roerich.algorithms.NNClassifier(n_hidden=10, n_epochs=10, batch_size=64, lr=0.1, l2=0.0) # detection cpd = ChangePointDetectionClassifier(base_classifier=clf, metric='KL_sym', periods=1, window_size=100, step=1, n_runs=1) score, cps_pred = cpd.predict(X) cps_pred array([ 194, 399, 598, 803, 1001, 1199, 1399, 1598, 1800]) ChangePointDetectionRuLSIF Similarly, ChangePointDetectionRuLSIF method also estimates probability density ratio between two windows of the signal. However, it does it using regression models with the RuLSIF loss function. They directly predict the ratios without learning individual distributions. Roerich provides two following RuLSIF models. NNRuLSIFRegressor model is a shallow Neural Network implemented in PyTorch. And GBDTRuLSIFRegressor is a Gradient Boosting over Regression Trees. The following examples show how to use them for change point detection. from roerich.algorithms import NNRuLSIFRegressor, ChangePointDetectionRuLSIF # pytorch NN regressor with RuLSIF loss function reg = NNRuLSIFRegressor(n_hidden=10, n_epochs=10, batch_size=64, lr=0.1, l2=0.0, alpha=0.05) # detection cpd = ChangePointDetectionRuLSIF(reg, metric='PE', periods=1, window_size=100, step=1, n_runs=1) score, cps_pred = cpd.predict(X) # visualization roerich.display(X, cps_true, score, cps_pred) from roerich.algorithms import GBDTRuLSIFRegressor # regressor with RuLSIF loss function reg = GBDTRuLSIFRegressor(n_estimators=10, max_depth=2) # detection cpd = ChangePointDetectionRuLSIF(reg, metric='PE', periods=1, window_size=100, step=1, n_runs=1) score, cps_pred = cpd.predict(X) cps_pred array([ 206, 400, 596, 798, 1001, 1201, 1401, 1600, 1799]) OnlineNNClassifier OnlineNNClassifier is based on the same principles as the previous methods. But it uses a single Neural Network to detect change points in the whole time series. The network scans the signal point by point ( window_size=1 ) and updates its weights online.

In result, the method is faster than previous algorithms, because it fits the network online and reuses it from previous iterations. from roerich.algorithms import OnlineNNClassifier # detection cpd = OnlineNNClassifier(net='default', scaler=\"default\", metric=\"KL_sym\", periods=1, window_size=1, lag_size=100, step=1, n_epochs=10, lr=0.1, lam=0.0001, optimizer=\"Adam\") score, cps_pred = cpd.predict(X) # visualization roerich.display(X, cps_true, score, cps_pred)","title":"OnlineNNClassifier"},{"location":"examples/demo/#onlinennrulsif","text":"OnlineNNRuLSIF is the same as OnlineNNClassifier , but uses Neural Network regression model with the RuLSIF loss function fitted online. from roerich.algorithms import OnlineNNRuLSIF cpd = OnlineNNRuLSIF(alpha=0.05, net='default', scaler=\"default\", periods=1, window_size=1, lag_size=100, step=1, n_epochs=10, lr=0.1, lam=0.0001, optimizer=\"Adam\") score, cps_pred = cpd.predict(X) cps_pred array([ 198, 402, 601, 798, 1006, 1203, 1401, 1604, 1804])","title":"OnlineNNRuLSIF"},{"location":"examples/seismic/","text":"(function() { function addWidgetsRenderer() { var requireJsScript = document.createElement('script'); requireJsScript.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.3.4/require.min.js'; var mimeElement = document.querySelector('script[type=\"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json\"]'); var jupyterWidgetsScript = document.createElement('script'); var widgetRendererSrc = 'https://unpkg.com/@jupyter-widgets/html-manager@*/dist/embed-amd.js'; var widgetState; // Fallback for older version: try { widgetState = mimeElement && JSON.parse(mimeElement.innerHTML); if (widgetState && (widgetState.version_major < 2 || !widgetState.version_major)) { widgetRendererSrc = 'jupyter-js-widgets@*/dist/embed.js'; } } catch(e) {} jupyterWidgetsScript.src = widgetRendererSrc; document.body.appendChild(requireJsScript); document.body.appendChild(jupyterWidgetsScript); } document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', addWidgetsRenderer); }()); Earthquake detection Description This example is about an earthquake detection using change point detection methods. We use data from Global Seismogram Viewer (GSV) developed by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) . The viewer shows seismic wave arrivals for large earthquakes at seismic recording stations around the world. Scientists use the arrival times to identify the location of the earthquake, determine how deep it was, exactly when it occurred, and for other purposes. These seismic records also help to explore Earth\u2019s inner structure, because the traveling waves bounce and diffract at different speeds and angles, depending on the density, solidity and other characteristics of the Earth. In this example, we estimate seismic wave arrival using the change point detection technique. We consider an earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011 near the east coast of Honshu in Japan, and has a magnitude of 9.1. A range of stations recorded the wave from this earthquake over the world. We took data from CASY station in Antarctica in 11825 km from the center of the earthquake. Data download We use IRIS URL Builder Web Service to download seismograms from the station. In this example, we use data in the BHZ channel, recorded with a sample rate of 20 Hz, and contains 216000 records for 3 hours. Run the following lines of code to download the data and unzip it. # !wget -O \"fdsnws.zip\" \"http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query?net=IU&sta=CASY&starttime=2011-03-11T05:00:00&endtime=2011-03-11T08:00:00&format=geocsv.zip\" # !unzip -o -q fdsnws.zip -d fdsnws # import of basic libraries import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib import cm import pandas as pd import numpy as np import roerich Now we read the data file.

We scale it with StandardScaler and add some noise to the signal. It is optional, but sometimes it can be helpful. Moreover, adding noise is a regularization technique for change point detection methods. It helps to reduce the number of false alarms, for example. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler # scale the signal ss = StandardScaler().fit(X) X_ss = ss.transform(X) # add noise for regularization X_ss += np.random.normal(0, 0.01, X_ss.shape) Change point detection We apply ChangePointDetectionClassifier method to identify the seismic wave arrival time. Here, we use RandomForestClassifier as a basic classifier. You can use any other binary classifier you like. The figures below show, that the change point score has several peaks.

It decreases the number of change points within one activity. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler # scale the signal ss = StandardScaler().fit(X) X_ss = ss.transform(X) # add noise for regularization X_ss += np.random.normal(0, 0.1, X_ss.shape)","title":"Preprocessing"},{"location":"examples/wisdm/#change-point-detection","text":"We use ChangePointDetectionClassifier method to estimate switches between different regimes of the time series.
