`Roerich` is a python library for online and offline change point detection for time series analysis, signal processing, and segmentation. It was named after the painter Nicholas Roerich, known as the Master of the Mountains. Read more at: https://www.roerich.org.

Currently, the library contains official implementations of change point detection algorithms based on direct density ratio estimation from the following articles:

## Dependencies and install

```
pip install roerich
```
or
```python
git clone https://github.com/HSE-LAMBDA/roerich.git
cd roerich
pip install -e .
```

## Basic usage

(See more examples in the [documentation](https://hse-lambda.github.io/roerich).)

The following code snippet generates a noisy synthetic data, performs change point detection, and displays the results. If you use own dataset, make
sure that it has a shape `(seq_len, n_dims)`.
```python
import roerich
from roerich.algorithms import ChangePointDetectionClassifier

# generate time series
X, cps_true = roerich.generate_dataset(period=200, N_tot=2000)

# detection
cpd = ChangePointDetectionClassifier()
score, cps_pred = cpd.predict(X)

# visualization
roerich.display(X, cps_true, score, cps_pred)
```
